# Natality-project

This project describes the steps taken in a project aiming at predicting the week of birth with data. We used the 2018 CDC Natablity file. The work was performed in the context of my Springboard capstone projet.

## Overview

The project comprises all steps of Data Science work broken down as follows:
* Data collection and wangling: done with R (RStudio)
* Exploratory Data Analysis: using Tableau Public for visual EDA and Python (iPython notebook) for statistical data analysis
* Machine learning: using Python - mostly scikit-learn in iPython notebook
* Reporting: using LaTeX
